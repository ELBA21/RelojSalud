# This repository is gonna be totally redundant

Idk what to write here

The idea is to make a API that's get some json from my
smartwatch and store it in a database for later analysis

Well gadgetbridgde already do that but I want to study

I thing there 2 main parts

- Work with the training JSON
  - Automatically post the json in a MongoDB database
  - Make some analysis in the data
  - Work with the notifications JSON

- Work with the other data of the .db files
  - Export the data to a more friendly format (CSV, JSON)
  - Make some analysis in the data

The idea is run this thing on my server adn eventually run my own llm using
something like langchain and AirLLM in N8N to make all the reports that I need
